Drug Inventory Analysis Using BigQuery and Python
Introduction
In this project, we analyse a drug inventory dataset stored and processed in BigQuery. The data was uploaded from two CSV files into BigQuery, joined into a consolidated view using SQL, and then further analysed in a Python environment using BigFrames and Pandas.

The analysis focuses on key aspects of drug inventory management, such as the distribution of drug quantities across different warehouse locations, identifying the most common active ingredients, and understanding the relationships between drugs, their side effects, and their approved medical indications.

This report will walk you through the different stages of the analysis, from data extraction to visualisation, providing key insights from the drug inventory.
